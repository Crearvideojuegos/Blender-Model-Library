## About me

Hi! I write games and I like it! I'm Alex and welcome to my Github! I'm Gamedev and Gamedesigner and I upload my projects to Github to share them and discuss how they are programmed, which you will find later in this archive.

The reason is that I like my public repositories to be educational first and foremost. In the README you will find hints on how to improve the code!

If you like what I do, please follow me on my social networks!

## About the project

In this repository I upload the .blend files with the models I have created for my games.

These models are created according to the needs I have for the games I am creating. 
You can find from quickly made LowPoly models to block models or better models created for the final game.

Remember: In the _ModelImages folder of each project you will find an image with a preview of the models.
